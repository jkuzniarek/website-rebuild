  <p>
    In case you've missed the sitewide self promotion I'm calling a
    banner my name is Julien Kuzniarek. I'm currently an Integration Engineer
    at <a href="http://www.mynetsvs.com">Net Synergy Virtual Solutions</a> in
    Tampa, FL where I develop <b>web scraping</b> robots
    and data <b>Extraction, Transformation, and Loading</b> solutions.
    I typically work with a variety of tools such as RESTful interfaces,
    Kofax Kapow, Apache NiFi, and SQL databases.
  </p>
  <p>
  I am a graduate of the University of South Florida (go Bulls!) where I earned
  a <b>Bachelor of Science</b> in Information Studies, and kindled my
  interest in programming and web development.
</p>
<p>
  I built this site to serve as a personal digital billboard introducing myself and
  my work, as well as a blog of sorts. This site is dynamically served off
  <a href="http://www.pythonanywhere.com">pythonanywhere.com</a>
  with a significant portion of the content stored in and retrieved from a
  database. The primary desired externalities of converting my previous static
  website to this one were to simplify the publishing process for myself, to provide myself
  with knowledge and experience in web development using more than just HTML/CSS,
  to demonstrate my familiarity with <b>SQL</b> and <b>Python<b>
  (my preferred language), and to get hands on with the Flask framework.
</p>
<p>
  My personal interests include, organizational structures, cellular automata, artificial sentience,
  social design, urban planning and development, mass transit, and even history.
  These interests are each tied together and rooted in my love for <b>systems
  analysis and design</b> combined with my propensity to examine both the impact of the
  perspectives people hold on their actions and decisions, and the
  cascading effects that can occur from small changes to a system.
