# website-rebuild
This is a rebuild of my existing personal website: jkuzniarek.me.
In addition to redoing the existing site's styles, the purpose of this rebuild is to convert the site from a static html/css site to a client-server model site where a significant portion of the content is stored in a database.
The primary desired externality of this endeavor is to give myself knowledge and experience in web development using the Flask framework and MongoDB via mlab.com.

To initialize the site:
1. 'cd' to the project directory
2. 'source bin/activate'
2. 'python init.py'
3. visit localhost:5000 in your browser to confirm
